Enhanced RSS Feeds so that all have a logo for the source.

On the Demo version the status for "Ollama Online" should read "Ollama Offline" and be in red. AI Model "Static Data" should also be red.

Improve AI Model Display to show if thinking is on or off with a small brain icon. (use same one from my ai-scanner tool)
Maybe adjust the prompt to be less complex for AI models not using thinking mode because they seem to fail to generate the signals and insights well enough.

Then eventually I could setup a BYOK (bring your own key) model for users who want to use the app but don't have the required hardware to run it themselves locally. They'll have to purchase a license for the app and can use it on a server that I host for them with their AI 3rd party AI model of choice (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini ... etc). This would allow users to run the app on a server and use the AI features while I receive a small monthly commission for each sale. This would be a subscription model and requires user accounts, a payment processor and a database to store user information and payment history.
